# gallery_clone

This app is a clone from the [Flutter Gallery](https://github.com/flutter/gallery)

# Why I'm redeveloping it from scratch

Because i just have finished my military service and i want a refresher for my knowledge in flutter
and in the same way pushing my skills to their limits and put my self out of my comfort zone.
so i was looking for a complete, good design, robust project  written with high quality standard
and sure open source because i will face troubles and bugs sooner or later on my journey of
development   so i chose this app.
it is support 6 Platforms :

- Android ([Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.flutter.demo.gallery), [.apk][latest release])
- iOS (locally)
- web ([gallery.flutter.dev](https://gallery.flutter.dev/))
- macOS ([.zip][latest release])
- Linux ([.tar.gz][latest release])
- Windows ([.zip][latest release]).

but i will just focus on Mobile Only 

# Here is a summary from the flutter team.

# Flutter Gallery

Flutter Gallery is a resource to help developers evaluate and use Flutter.
It is a collection of Material Design & Cupertino widgets, behaviors, and vignettes
implemented with Flutter. We often get asked how one can see Flutter in action,
and this gallery demonstrates what Flutter provides and how it behaves in the
wild.
